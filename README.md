# Fonctions_package

This repository aims at gathering some R functions that are not currently available.
So far, eight functions have been designed:
- one function for converting \ into / (for windows paths)
- one function that permits to create a formula from the columns of a data frame
- one function that reproduces the ouput of the SAS proc freq
- one function that allows to draw the lift effect and the lift curve
- one function that implements a procedure for clustering via kmeans
- three functions that allow user to fill gaps in time series

The main goal of these functions is to facilitate data analysis and interpretation of predictive models.
