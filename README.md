# Fonctions_package

This repository aims at gathering some R functions that are not currently available.
So far, four functions have been designed:
- one function for converting \ into / (for windows paths)
- one function that permit to create a formula from the columns of a data frame
- one function that reproduce the ouput of the SAS proc freq
- one function that allows to draw the lift effect and the lift curve

The main goal of these functions is to facilitate data analysis and interpretation of predictive models.
